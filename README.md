- 👋 Hi, I’m @CristinaCosma ! - I fluently speak and write 5 languages, among which are French, English and Spanish.
- I lived in Canada and Europe and consider myself a "citizen of the world".
- 👀 I’m interested in modern computer programming languages such as Python, Go, Clojure, SQL and databases, and in the tech opportunities they can offer.
- I am an architect too, meaning I have a great imagination, a sense of aesthetics and well made things, combined with a practical and functional personality. I like to build nice and useful things and make them work. 
- 🌱 I’m well into programming in the last few years, from a bit of Backend and now full-time into Data Science and Machine Learning (+ other tools and languages) because I like it and it brings me satisfaction to see the results. I was happy to discover that programming is fun and it nourishes my need to dig the "whys" and "hows" fo things, to understand how things work, to be part of the process of making. I also realized that programming is challenging enough for my brain to feel that it becomes "smarter" :) as it gets into a greater level of abstraction and complexity. On the other hand, I also have lots of experience with design specific programs, such as Adobe Suite (Photoshop, etc.), GIS mapping, 2D and 3D rendering.
- 💞️ In spare time, I might be with my family, taking a walk by the sea, or engage in some artistic hobby like painting or photography.
    I also love design and craftsmanship and making things with my hands (especially wood furniture, objects) ;
    I read about anything from tech to psychology, education, people, places, and of course, about programming.
