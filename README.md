- 👋 Hi, I’m @CristinaCosma ! - I fluently speak and write 5 languages, among which are French, English and Spanish.
- I lived in Canada and Europe and consider myself a "citizen of the world".
- I am an architect too, meaning I am visual, practical and analytical ; I also like to build nice and useful things and make them work. 
- 🌱 I’ve been well into programming in the last two years, from a bit of Backend and now full-time into Data Science and Machine Learning. I was happy to discover that programming is fun and challening and satisfies my need to understand how things work, to be part of the process of making. It is challenging enough as it gets into a greater level of abstraction and complexity. 
- 💞️ In spare time, I might be with my family, taking a walk by the sea, engage in photography,  eventually design or make something with my hands. 
    I read about anything from tech to psychology, education, people, places, and of course, about programming.
