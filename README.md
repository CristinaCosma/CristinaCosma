- 👋 Hi, I’m @CristinaCosma !
- 👀 I’m an architect and right now I am looking for tech opportunities.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Science and Machine Learning.
- 💞️ In my spare time I spend time with my child and family, or travel, or I make things with my hands (such as wood furniture or toys) ; I also read about anything from technology to psychology, education, people, places, and of course, about programming and computer science.
