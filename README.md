- 👋 Hi, I’m @CristinaCosma !
- I speak 5 [human] languages, lived in Europe and North America and I consider myself a "Citizen of the world".
- 👀 I’m interested in modern computer programming languages such as Python, Go, Clojure and SQL Databases, and the tech opportunities they can offer. I am an architect too, meaning I have a great sense of aesthetics and well made things, combined with a practical and functional personality. I like to make / build nice and useful things to the detail and I like to make them work. 
- 🌱 I’m actively learning Data Science and Machine Learning (+ other tools and languages) because is a must for the future... and the future is now ! I was happy to discover that programming is fun and it satisfies my need to dig the "whys" and "hows", to understand how things work, to be part of the process of making things. I also realized that this level of abstraction and comprehension makes my brain exercise the areas which had remained somewhat sleepy before, and thus, programming is challenging enough for my brain to feel that it becomes "smarter" :). On the other hand, I also have lots of experience with design specific programs, such as Adobe Suite (Photoshop, etc.), GIS mapping, 2D and 3D rendering.
- 💞️ In spare time, I might be with my family, taking a walk by the sea, taking/editing pictures or engage in manual/artistic hobbies.
    I also love design and craftsmanship and making things with my hands (especially wood furniture, objects) ;
    I read about anything from tech to psychology, education, people, places, and of course, about programming.
